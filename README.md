##### Date of completion: 22/11/2024
##### The data was retrieved from: [Neurosynth-Anxiety](https://neurosynth.org/analyses/terms/anxiety/)

This repository provides a Jupyter Notebook that contains the code to visualise fMRI data. The dataset is composed of two .nii.gz files (one structural and one functional), focused on anxiety-related studies. The data are publicly accessible via [Neurosynth](https://neurosynth.org/), a meta-analysis platform that aggregates results from thousands of fMRI studies.

### Home assignment
This file contains the implementation of the code logic. It imports the necessary data regarding anxiety from [Neurosynth.org](https://neurosynth.org/analyses/terms/anxiety/) and creates their visualisation.

### anatomical_anxiety.nii.gz
This file contains the structural MRI data.

### anxiety_uniformity-test_z_FDR_0.01.nii.gz
This file contains the functional data for anxiety.
